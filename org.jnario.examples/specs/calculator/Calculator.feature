  In order to avoid silly mistakes
  As a math idiot
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers
  
  Scenario: Add two numbers
    Calculator calculator = new Calculator()
    Given I have entered "50" into the calculator
      calculator.enter(args.first)
    And I have entered "70" into the calculator
    When I press "add"
      calculator.press(args.first)
    Then the result should be "120" 
      calculator.result => args.first
